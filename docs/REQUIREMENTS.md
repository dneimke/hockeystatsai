# Requirements

## Core Requirement

* As a user, I want to ask plain language questions about my data and get answers, so that I can easily query my database without writing SQL.
* As a user, I want to be presented with example questions and then be able to ask follow-up questions until I choose to exit, so that I can explore the data interactively.
* As a user, I want the service to correctly interpret competition short names (e.g., "M1M") when I ask questions, so that I can use more concise language.
* As a user, I want the system to provide the LLM with a flexible and robust understanding of data model rules and relationships, rather than a monolithic prompt, so that the LLM can generate more accurate and complex queries.

## Feature Backlog

* Support for more complex questions (e.g., with joins and aggregations).
* Ability to handle conversational context (e.g., follow-up questions).
* A web-based interface for a more user-friendly experience.
