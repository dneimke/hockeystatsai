# GEMINI Project

This project is a spike to see if we can create a REPL-like interface to query a local relational SQL database that contains player stats.

The database contains information about field hockey competitions, fixtures, and player statistics over a 10 year period. The data has been scraped from the Adelaide Metro Hockey website and can be used to see details for any game played over the period. The player statistics allow you to see a historical overview for any given player - goals, games played, which division they played in

## Collaboration

To ensure we stay on track and keep changes focused, we will collaborate closely. This will make it easier to review changes before moving on to the next step.

## Coding Standards

*   **Embrace Modern Language Features:** Always utilize modern language and framework features to write cleaner, more concise, and more efficient code.
    *   **Example:** Prefer simple `using` statements over nested ones for resource management.
*   **Address Linting Errors:** Actively fix linting errors, especially nullability warnings, to improve code reliability and prevent runtime issues.
